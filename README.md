A MATLAB toolbox for computing **individual cone fundamentals** (observer-specific LMS spectral sensitivities and the RGB color matching functions derived from them) from biophysical parameters: opsin genotype, age, retinal field size, lens / macular / photopigment optical densities. The default Stockman & Rider (2023) photopigment + lens templates reproduce the CIE 170-1:2006 physiological standard observers (2-deg and 10-deg). Alternative templates (Govardovskii et al. 2000 for photopigments; Pokorny, Smith & Lutze 1987 and van de Kraats & van Norren 2007 for the age-dependent lens) can be substituted independently to model observer populations the CIE/S&R defaults don't cover. Output matches the reference Python implementation (`pycone`) to machine precision across the parity test suite (28 configurations &times; 5 output formats).

  <em>CIE 10-deg cone fundamentals (solid) vs. an age-60 observer under the van de Kraats &amp; van Norren 2007 lens model (dashed). Each cone is peak-normalized, so age-related lens yellowing shows up as a loss of sensitivity at short wavelengths -- visually clearest on L and M, since their peaks sit outside the lens-absorption band and are preserved by normalization, leaving the whole short-wavelength side pulled in by 30 to 40 percent. In absolute (un-normalized) units the S cone is in fact the most attenuated. Reproduced by the "Composing a figure from several observers" section of <code>toolbox/examples/Example18_PublicationFigures.m</code>.</em>

## Framework

The toolbox builds an L/M/S spectral sensitivity model from biophysical inputs (opsin genotype, age, retinal field size, lens and macular optical densities, per-cone photopigment optical densities, and lambda-max shifts) by traversing a four-stage pipeline:

1. **Photopigment absorbance.** A template positioned at the cone's lambda-max.
2. **Self-screening.** Beer-Lambert conversion from absorbance to relative retinal absorptance: `(1 - 10^(-OD * absorbance)) / (1 - 10^(-OD))`.
3. **Pre-receptoral filtering.** Lens and macular pigment density attenuate the retinal sensitivity to give the corneal cone fundamental.
4. **Quantal-to-energy.** Multiplication by wavelength converts photon-counting sensitivity to energy units (S&R 2023 Eq. 8).

Each stage's model is swappable: photopigment template (Stockman & Rider 2023 per-cone, Stockman & Rider 2023 common, or Govardovskii 2000), lens model (Stockman & Rider 2023, Pokorny 1987, or van de Kraats & van Norren 2007), and macular template. `OutputFormat` selects which stage to return (`absorbance`, `absorptance`, `quantal`, `energy`). Defaults reproduce the CIE 170 physiological standard observers; any input can be overridden individually to model a specific observer or to study the effect of one biophysical parameter.

## Relationship to pycone

[`pycone`](https://github.com/CVRL-IoO/Individual-CMFs) is the reference Python implementation of Stockman & Rider (2023). This toolbox is a MATLAB port of that model and matches pycone to machine precision on the configurations pycone supports (see [`tests/parity/README.md`](tests/parity/README.md)). It also provides some additional models for research use and a MATLAB-native interface, and a few points where the two implementations can differ in output are noted below for transparency.

**Additional models**

- Govardovskii et al. (2000) photopigment template (A1 and A2) for sub-400 nm extrapolation and cross-species use.
- Stockman & Rider (2023) common (shape-invariant) photopigment template (Table 4 column 3): one Fourier shape translated along log-wavelength to fit any cone, for cross-species / arbitrary lambda-max use.
- Pokorny, Smith & Lutze (1987) two-component age-dependent lens model. Its tabulated data start at 400 nm, and the toolbox reports nothing below that rather than flat-extrapolating. Its equations are published for ages 20-80 and the toolbox errors outside that span, because the paper does not sanction extrapolation. Table I is tabulated for a small pupil (<3 mm); scale `LensDensity` by 0.86 for a fully dilated eye (>7 mm), which the toolbox does not do for you. Prefer `VanDeKraats2007` -- fitted from 300 nm, with an aging formula its authors state applies at any age -- for sub-400 nm or out-of-span work (see the `Pokorny1987LensTemplate` class help).
- van de Kraats & van Norren (2007) five-component total-ocular-media lens model with field-size-aware Rayleigh-loss coefficient and UV coverage.

**Where outputs can differ from pycone**

- Peak normalization: by default the toolbox locates the sub-grid peak with `fminbnd`; pycone normalizes to the discrete sample maximum. Set the normalization method to the discrete option for exact parity.
- Wavelength sampling: the toolbox builds the grid with MATLAB's `(start:step:stop)'`; at fine step sizes this can differ from pycone's `np.arange` by a small floating-point amount.
- Applying a lambda-max shift to the fixed Mean L template is ambiguous; the toolbox warns and uses the Serine variant.

**Parameter precedence**

Assigning any of `LensDensity`, `MacularDensity`, `Lod`, `Mod`, or `Sod` directly auto-engages the corresponding `Custom` density algorithm and pins that value: it is no longer recomputed when you later change `Age`, `FieldSize`, or `LensModel`. Assigning `[]` is the inverse and returns the quantity to its formula (`obs.LensDensity = []`); because one formula produces all three cone densities together, clearing any of `Lod`, `Mod`, or `Sod` reverts the group. `Custom` itself cannot be assigned to an `*Algorithm` property -- it is a state that pinning a value produces. This differs from Asano, Fairchild & Blonde (2016), whose individual-observer model treats age and a separate optical-density deviation as independent parameters that compose; here a direct density assignment overrides the age / field-size formula rather than composing with it.

**Ergonomics**

- Round-trippable parameter snapshots via `getParameters` / `setParameters`.
- Visualization: twelve plot and compare methods on `IndividualCMF` (`plotLMS`, `plotXYZ`, `plotRGBCMFs`, `plotChromaticity`, `plotAbsorbance`, `plotAbsorptance`, `plotQuantalEnergy`, `plotLens`, `plotMacular`, `plotDiagnostics`, `compareTo`, `plot`). Each draws into `gca` by default and takes `Parent=` an axes or a tile, so multi-panel figures compose with MATLAB's own `tiledlayout` / `nexttile` rather than a toolbox-specific plotter.

See [`tests/parity/README.md`](tests/parity/README.md) for the configurations covered and notes on where the two implementations differ.

## Requirements

- **MATLAB R2023b** or later (uses `dictionary`, `configureDictionary`, `arguments` blocks, and modern Name=Value syntax). Plain Text Live Script rendering of the examples requires R2025a or newer.
- **Toolbox dependencies:** none. The toolbox uses only core MATLAB functions.

## Install

The toolbox installs as a `.mltbx` Add-On. Download the latest `.mltbx` from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/sfu-cs-vision-lab/individual-cmfs-matlab/releases) and either:

- **Double-click** the `.mltbx` file -- MATLAB's Add-On Explorer will install it.
- **Or from the MATLAB command window** (downloads and installs the latest release):
  ```matlab
  url = "https://github.com/sfu-cs-vision-lab/individual-cmfs-matlab/releases/latest/download/individual-cmfs-matlab.mltbx";
  matlab.addons.install(websave(tempname + ".mltbx", url));
  ```

The Add-On adds `toolbox/` to your MATLAB path on every session and registers the toolbox with the Add-On Manager (uninstall there if needed). The worked examples, the Getting Started guide and the reference documentation are bundled in the `.mltbx` and install with the toolbox; the test suite is not -- clone the repo if you need the tests.

Once installed, the reference is in MATLAB's own Help Browser:

```matlab
doc Individual CMF Toolbox
```

## Quick Start

> **Tip.** Click [![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=sfu-cs-vision-lab/individual-cmfs-matlab) at the top of this README to launch the project in MATLAB Online without cloning.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sfu-cs-vision-lab/individual-cmfs-matlab.git
```

Open `individual-cmfs-matlab.prj` in MATLAB to register the project paths, then open the Getting Started guide (a one-minute orientation and a map of the examples):

```matlab
edit toolbox/doc/GettingStarted.m
% Click Run, or press F5
```

### Note on Example Files

The Getting Started guide lives at `toolbox/doc/GettingStarted.m`, and the 20 worked examples live in `toolbox/examples/`. All are authored as **Plain Text Live Scripts** (R2025a or newer): they render with rich formatting in the Live Editor while remaining standard executable `.m` scripts in older MATLAB releases. Open one in the Editor for the rich-text view, or read it directly as commented code.

## Usage

```matlab
% CIE 2006 10-degree standard observer (default)
obs = IndividualCMF();

% CIE 2006 2-degree standard observer
obs = IndividualCMF(StandardObserver=2);

% StandardObserver is also a settable property: snap back to standard
% after editing a custom observer
obs.Age = 50;                     % drifts out of standard
disp(obs.StandardObserver);       % 0
obs.StandardObserver = 2;         % snap back to 2-deg standard
disp(obs.StandardObserver);       % 2

% Custom observer: 60 years old, 4-degree field, van de Kraats & van Norren 2007 lens model
obs = IndividualCMF(Age=60, FieldSize=4, LensModel="VanDeKraats2007");

% Genotype-driven L-cone (Alanine at codon 180)
obs = IndividualCMF(Genotype=struct(L_180="Ala"));

% Govardovskii (2000) continuous photopigment template
obs = IndividualCMF(PhotopigmentModel="Govardovskii2000");

% Manual override engages Custom mode (preserved across Age/FieldSize edits)
obs.LensDensity = 1.2;
disp(obs.LensDensityAlgorithm);   % "Custom"
obs.LensDensity = [];             % back to the model-driven value

% Evaluate cone sensitivities and derived quantities.
% Back to a standard observer: XYZ warns for a non-standard one, since the
% transformation matrix is derived for the CIE standard.
% Case follows the color-science convention: tristimulus quantities
% (LMS, RGB, XYZ, V*) uppercase; chromaticity coordinates (lm, xy, ls)
% lowercase.
obs = IndividualCMF();
wl  = (380:1:780)';
LMS = obs.LMS(wl);             % L, M, S as Nx3
RGB = obs.RGB(wl);             % RGB CMFs at the configured Primaries
XYZ = obs.XYZ(wl);             % CIE XYZ (2-deg or 10-deg matrix by FieldSize)
V   = obs.Luminance(wl);       % V*(lambda) = y-bar row of LMS->XYZ
lm  = obs.lmChromaticity(wl);  % LMS-sum chromaticity
xy  = obs.xyChromaticity(wl);  % CIE xy from XYZ
ls  = obs.MacLeodBoynton(wl);  % MacLeod-Boynton (l_MB, s_MB)

% One-off query in a different output format without mutating obs
A = obs.LMS(wl, OutputFormat="absorptance");

% Compare two observers
obs.compareTo(IndividualCMF(Age=70), Title="Effect of aging");

% Plot methods (all accept Wavelength=, Title=, Parent= options;
% plotLMS/plotAbsorbance/plotAbsorptance also accept Cones= and Log=;
% plotXYZ accepts Channels=)
obs.plotLMS(Cones=["L" "M"]);            % L and M only, observer's OutputFormat
obs.plotXYZ(Channels="Y");                % Y (luminous-efficiency) channel only
obs.plotLMS(Log=true);                    % log10 y-axis

% Multi-panel figures use MATLAB's own layout, via Parent=
tiledlayout(1, 2);
obs.plotLMS(Parent=nexttile());
obs.plotXYZ(Parent=nexttile());

% Build an array of observers across one parameter axis
observers = IndividualCMF.across('Age', [25 50 75], ...
    LensModel="VanDeKraats2007", FieldSize=10);
densities = [observers.LensDensity];

% Pre-receptoral filter spectra (lens + macular OD vs wavelength)
lensOD    = obs.getLensDensitySpectrum(wl);
macularOD = obs.getMacularDensitySpectrum(wl);

% Round-trip: capture, edit, restore
params = obs.getParameters();
obs2 = IndividualCMF();
obs2.setParameters(params);

% Export to CSV
data = obs.evaluate(wl, Data="LMS");
writetable(data, "cone_fundamentals.csv");
```

The full set of name-value options (genotype dictionary, hybrid opsin variants, per-stage algorithm choice, custom RGB primaries, normalization method, output format, log-output toggle) is documented in the `IndividualCMF` class docstring. The `toolbox/examples/` folder demonstrates each option in context.

For a tour of how the toolbox is internally organized (class hierarchy, the four-stage LMS pipeline, design patterns, and how to add a new template or algorithm mode), see [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Documentation

Three places, in the order most people want them:

- **The Getting Started guide** -- a one-minute orientation and a map of the examples. `edit toolbox/doc/GettingStarted.m`, or the Getting Started entry in the Help Browser.
- **The worked examples** -- twenty plain-text Live Scripts in `toolbox/examples/`, each one task, in a deliberate order. They also appear in the Help Browser with their figures, so they can be read without running anything.
- **The reference** -- `doc Individual CMF Toolbox` after installing, covering every documented class and method. It is generated from the class help comments by `buildtool doc`, so it cannot disagree with the source, and editing a help comment is what changes the published page. The landing page opens with the tasks readers most often arrive with, each linked to the example that answers it.

Reference pages are build output rather than checked-in files. `buildtool package` regenerates them, so a packaged `.mltbx` always ships current documentation.

## Building and Testing

The project uses MATLAB's `buildtool`. From the repo root:

```matlab
buildtool                 % Default tasks: check + test
buildtool clean           % Remove generated reports
buildtool check           % Static analysis on toolbox/ via codeIssues
buildtool test            % Run tests, emit JUnit XML and Cobertura coverage to reports/
buildtool doc             % Generate the Help Browser reference into toolbox/doc/
                          % from the class help comments. Runs the examples so
                          % their figures appear, so it takes a few minutes.
buildtool package         % Build a redistributable .mltbx into dist/ (depends on check + test + doc).
                          % Version is read from VERSION and the toolbox UUID
                          % from resources/toolbox/identifier.txt.
```

CI runs the same buildfile across MATLAB R2023b, R2024b, R2025b, and R2026a on every push and pull request.
